          <p>Hey! My name is Leila, and I am a technical recruiter here in Toronto. I am borderline addicted to sushi (okay maybe wine & cheese as well), love all things technology, and am currently keen on learning javascript. I work at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sage-recruiting" target="_blank">Sage Recruiting</a> - a boutique staffing agency geared towards niche software development roles (among a couple others) and love it here. Thanks for visting my little corner of the web!</p>

        <h2>Recruitment Needs a Facelift</h2>

          <p>Recruitment could use a facelift - and we are recruiters that actually care. I care so much that I have made a github wiki to show all of you how much I want to speak your language! I am loving the process of learning how to code, and it most importantly teaches me some of the basic skills *you* use everyday. Wanna give me a shot? <a href="mailto:leila@sagerecruiting.me" target="_blank">Reach out!</a></p>

    <section class="Sushi">

      <h2>Somehow I Became a Food Blogger</h2>

        <p>I *might* have a small obsession with sushi. And when I say that, I mean... a really, really absurd obsession with sushi. So much so that I built my first website showcasing all the best sushi in Toronto - it has an instagram account and everything. Check it out at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/6ixsushi" <a href="mailto:leila@sagerecruiting.me" target="_blank">6ixsushi on Instagram</a> or my hack <a href="https://www.6ixsushi.com" <a href="mailto:leila@sagerecruiting.me" target="_blank">website</a> that is in the process of getting a new look in 2017!</p>
