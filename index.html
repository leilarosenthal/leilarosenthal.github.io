          <p>Hey! My name is Leila, and I am a technical recruiter here in Toronto. I am borderline addicted to sushi (okay maybe wine & cheese as well), love all things technology, and am currently keen on learning javascript. I work at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sage-recruiting" target="_blank">Sage Recruiting</a> - a boutique staffing agency geared towards niche software development roles at startups & SMBs in Toronto. Thanks for visting my little corner of the web!</p>

        <h2>Recruitment Can Be Done Better.</h2>

          <p>Recruitment isn't a numbers game. I have internalized the notion that quality is better than quality, especially when it comes to doing my job. Through learning the tech, adding some personal flare, and putting in the extra effort, I connect with the best people for the job.</p>

    <section class="Sushi">

      <h2>Somehow I Became a Food Blogger</h2>

        <p>I *might* have a small obsession with sushi. And when I say that, I mean... a really, really absurd obsession with sushi. So much so that I built my first website showcasing all the best sushi in Toronto - it has an instagram account too! Check it out at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/6ixsushi" <a href="mailto:leila@sagerecruiting.me" target="_blank">6ixsushi on Instagram</a> or my hack <a href="https://www.6ixsushi.com" <a href="mailto:leila@sagerecruiting.me" target="_blank">website</a> that is in the process of getting a new, more responsive look soon!</p>
