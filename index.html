          <p>Hey! My name is Leila (pronounced like the girl in Futurama, haha) and I am a technical recruiter here in Toronto. I am borderline addicted to sushi (okay maybe wine & cheese as well), love all things technology, and am currently keen on learning javascript. I work at Sage Recruiting - a boutique staffing agency geared towards niche software development roles (among a couple others) and love it here. Thanks for coming to my little corner of the web!</p>

        <h2>Why we do things differently</h2>

          <p>I personally have a love hate relationship with recruitment. The best way I can cope with these feelings is by making recruitment the best that it can be. If you're reading this right now, I have probably sent you a pretty personal email, falttering you about your projects, and no, I don't send these emails to everyone in the city :) I reached out because you are awesome at what you do, and I'm confident we can help with your job search whenever you are ready</p>

          <p>If you stumbled upon this site and I didn't reach out... wow! What's up?! How did you end up here?! Reach out!

      <h2>My Sushi Obsession</h2>

        <p>So I mentioned this earlier, but I might have a small obsession with sushi. And when I say that, I mean... a really, really absurd obsession with sushi. So much so that I built my first website showcasing all the best sushi in Toronto - it has an instagram account and everything. Check it out at <a href="www.instagram.com/6ixsushi">6ixsusuhi on Instagram</a></p> or my hack <a href="www.6ixsushi.com">website</a> that needs a facelift.
